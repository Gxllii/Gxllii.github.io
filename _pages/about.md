I am an Associate Professor at the State Key Lab of Processors, Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences supervised by [Prof. Xiaobing Feng][3], and received my M.S. degree and B.S. degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University.   
I am a member of the programming languages and compilers group (led by [Prof. Huimin Cui][7]) at ICT, CAS. I am also a visiting fellow of the CORG group (led by [Prof. Jingling Xue][8]) at UNSW Sydney. My research interests lie at the intersection of programming systems and artificial intelligence. My current research focuses on programming languages, compilers, and run-time systems for emerging AI applications and accelerators. I have published 30+ papers in prestigious conferences and journals such as ASPLOS, CGO, TACO, and TCAD.

**We are looking for self-motivated students in deep learning systems and compilers. Please send me an email with your CV if interested.**
